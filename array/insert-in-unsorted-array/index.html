        <h2>Insert in unsorted array</h2>

        <p> 
            Insert in Unsorted array is very simple. 
            You just need to append item at the end of the array
        </p>

        <h3>Time Complexity O(1)</h3>
        <p>As we don't need to go through complete array.</p>

        <h3>Auxiliary Space O(1)</h3>
        <p>As we are using one space to add element</p>
